## SnakeBite
 _Metal Gear Solid V Mod Manager_
 
### What is SnakeBite?

SnakeBite is a project designed to help users and mod developers to
install and manage mods for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.

Since MGSV is not designed with modding in mind, the game archives must
be modified directly which can be a daunting task for the inexperienced user.

The goal of SnakeBite is to provide a simple way for mod developers and users
to create, install and manage modfiles. To do this we have created an XML
metadata format which will be included alongside the mod and used to check
for conflicts/inconsistencies before any actual modification to the game data
is performed.

### Requirements

SnakeBite uses [GzsTool](https://www.github.com/Atvaark/GzsTool) by Atvaark
and thus requires GzsTool to be installed into the application directory
to function.

**Until GzsTool implements singular file extraction, please use the included GzsTool only**
