### About SnakeBite

SnakeBite is a Launcher/mod manager for Metal Gear Solid V.

As the game does not directly support modding, it is required to unpack and repack the game data to mod the game. SnakeBite is an attempt to create a simple solution for users and mod developers to assist with modding the game.

The application comes in two parts:

1. SnakeBite: for installing and uninstalling mods
2. makebite: for creating mods to install using the main application


### Installing Mods

To use SnakeBite, you will need a compatible mod file. These can be provided directly by the mod author, or can be created using makebite.

SnakeBite also includes a select number of mods available for download within the app. See the Download Mods tab in SnakeBite for more information (if the tab is not visible the service is currently offline).

### Creating Modfiles

For information regarding using makebite to create mod files, please see here:

### Found a bug?

Please submit a bug report to GitHub with as much detail as possible. If you are using version 0.8.0.0, please include log.txt, which is accessed by double clicking the version in the main window, or found in your SnakeBite install directory (default %LocalAppData%\SnakeBite). Warning: the logfile is reset every time you launch SnakeBite so please save it immediately after the application crashes.
