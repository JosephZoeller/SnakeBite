Changelog
0.8.5.0
Fixed: NameToHash returning 0 for files in root, side effect of which would remove foxpatch.dat from 00.dat when uninstalling a mod that had such a file - thanks Summerfag for narrowing down the issue.
Updated qar_dictionary to MGSV-QAR-Dictionary-Project 2016-12-06

0.8.4.0
Version bump for version strings (still need to unify)

All projects
.net target dropped from v4.5.2 to v4.5 which gives windows 8 coverage by default.

Makebite:
1.0.7.1 added MGSV version box
Will use metadata version even if it doesn't exist in version box.
Packs files in fpkd by extension order:
{ "fox2", "evf", "parts", "vfxlb", "vfx", "vfxlf", "veh", "frld", "des", "bnd", "tgt", "phsd", "ph", "sim", "clo", "fsd", "sdf", "lua", "lng" }
Packs files in fpk by alphabetical order.

Snakebite
Fixed: No longer kills the steam cache verification window, was just on a  timer, now disabled completely and the user must judge when to continue. TODO: bring to front?
Fixed: Uninstall not handling empty fpk files. Since they weren't removed they'd be marked as System, thus give 'conflicts with system files' error.

Log window remain if ProcessWindow.Show backgroundworker throws exception.

Changes to various messages to be more useful, or to explain around bugs lol

Adjusted Logging during uninstall to be more usefull, and less spammy which should help performance a bit.

Stoped updater check.
Removed Download mods tab.
Both relied on tophers server which he brought down.

Changed settings link 'the latest version is here' to point to nexusmods snakebite page, which is better for average user (plus I don't know if topher would want to pull my butchered version of his project lol).

Log now copies to log_pre.txt before it clears
Added Open Logs button to settings
