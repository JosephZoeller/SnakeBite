A number of variables need to be updated in snakebite when mgsv is updated.

Search for 'GAMEVERSION' and read the notes.

Roughly its:
Makebite:
GzsLib - qar flags
Build - MGSVVersionStr

Snakebite:
GzsLib - qar flags
SettingManager - static vars for dat hash, version, dat sizes
IsUpToDate isSpecialCase - manages whether older mod versions should be let through (for game updates where the dats didn't really change)

Making a build:
TODO document the process of making a release build
Snakebite uses NSIS to install:
https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download

You'll see the SnakeBite.nsi in the github repos root.
